# GPX-and-KML-OS-Map-Walk-Planner
Draw your GPX or KML track or route on top of Bing/OS maps. Aerial and Roadmap views also work. See the walk length and the start and end Ordnance Survey Grid References (UK Only). Save as GPX or KML. Upload the GPX to compatible GPS receivers. Save as KML for use with KML aware applications like Google Earth (Desktop) or Marble. Import GPX or KML to view and edit.
